# PLAN

List of possible improvements. Sorted roughly by priority. Verify before implementing.

## Backlog

- Expanded list view — taller list rows showing channel tags + latest 3-5 tracks. Not a new view mode; the list view itself expands when there's enough space using container queries (no toggle). Can use `getChannelTags()` from utils.
- 3D globe map view in addition to map view. Use Three.js (already a dependency). Someday/maybe.
- Auto live — client-side calculation using track.duration to sync playback across listeners. When a user tunes in, calculate what track should be playing based on durations. Falls back gracefully when durations are missing. TBD: for tracks missing duration, could fetch via `media-now getMedia()` on demand. Low effort.
- Test RTL-support
- We parse track.description inside TrackCard for links with LinkEntities, consider DB trigger or something to avoid computing this over and over
- Views: Saved views — CRUD + GUI. Use `localStorageCollectionOptions` (same pattern as play-history). Collection stores `{id, name, params}` where `params` is the serialized URL string. GUI: TBD (sidebar? dropdown? page?). A saved view is just a named bookmark — the full recipe stays in the URL.
  Views: as /mix input — mix crate sources become Views. Tags would query Supabase (real global results instead of local-only filtering). Crate UI (pills, suggestions, avatars) stays separate from the plumbing.
- OpenGraph share previews — proper `<meta>` tags on channel/track pages so links preview nicely in social/chat apps. Needs server-side data (load functions already fetch channel/track).
- Media Session API — OS-level lock screen / notification controls (play/pause/skip/artwork). Player already has all the hooks; wire up `navigator.mediaSession.metadata` and action handlers.
- Views: channel page (`/@slug`) — could use `processViewTracks` for its inline fuzzy+tag filter. Works fine now, low priority.
- Duplicate track detection — warn when adding a track URL that already exists in the channel. Could also surface duplicates in batch-edit (group by URL or media_id).
- Expand our broadcast schema with a custom JSON field (?) so we can push arbitrary data without updating the schema every time. We could, for example, put the player data of each deck from /mix

## Data & migration

- Play history threshold — currently a track is recorded to play history as soon as it starts playing. Instead, a play should count only after the user has listened long enough: the entire track if under 2 min, or half the duration (max 4 min), whichever is longest. Open questions: what happens when the user seeks/skips around within a track (accumulate actual play time vs. furthest position reached?), what about pausing and resuming, and should skipped tracks still appear in history with a `skipped` flag or not at all? Currently `addPlayHistoryEntry` fires in `playTrack()` (api.ts); would move to player.svelte using `timeupdate` events. Needs `getPlayCountThreshold(durationSec)` helper in play-history.ts and a way to pass `reason_start` to the player (e.g. via appState).

## In progress

- YouTube music credits in media-now — extract structured song/artist/album from YouTube watch pages.
  - **Research done**: YouTube embeds music metadata in `ytInitialData` → `horizontalCardListRenderer` (header "Music") → `videoAttributeViewModel`. A secondary `confirmDialogEndpoint` ("Song credits" dialog) has the same data plus optional `Writers`. No API key needed, single fetch to the watch page.
  - **Coverage**: 31/50 ko002 tracks had a music card, 14/50 had credits dialog. User uploads with no Content ID match return nothing.
  - **Fields available**: `song`, `artist`, `album`, `albumArt`, `writers?` — no year/duration from the card itself.
  - **Next steps**:
    1. Add `fetchCredits(id): Promise<MusicCredits | null>` to `media-now/src/providers/youtube.ts` (alongside existing `fetch` and `search`)
    2. Add `MusicCredits` type to `media-now/src/types.ts`
    3. Export from provider only (not top-level) — usage: `import { youtube } from 'media-now/providers/youtube'`
    4. Tests against known video IDs (Topic, official, user upload)
    5. Use in r4-sync-tests: enrich tracks with clean artist/song/album for MusicBrainz/Discogs lookup
  - **Status**: Implementation in progress on a branch in media-now. Can test integration in r4-sync-tests once merged.
  - **Probe scripts**: `yt-dump-50.ts`, `yt-probe-cards.ts`, `yt-probe-credits-raw.ts` — results in `yt-dump-50.json`, `yt-credits-raw.json`

## Needs research

- atproto scrobbling — on play, write an `fm.teal.alpha.feed.play` record to the user's PDS. Uses teal.fm's lexicon for cross-app interop (shared listening history across apps). Requires: OAuth account linking in settings, opt-in checkbox, one `createRecord` call per play. Fields to fill: `trackName`, `originUrl`, `musicServiceBaseDomain`, `playedTime`, `submissionClientAgent` (`org.radio4000/<version>`). Optionally enrich with MusicBrainz IDs. No dual-write, no sync — append-only, fire-and-forget. Proves out atproto OAuth plumbing needed for everything else. See also: teal.fm lexicon, npmx.dev Constellation pattern, r4 atproto spec.
- atproto as backend alternative — sign in with bluesky, sync channels/tracks. Major architectural shift. See github.com/radio4000/r4atproto
- direct IDB collection persistence — disabled due to performance problems. See collection-persistence.ts and docs/plan-tanstack-collection-idb-idea.md.
- Mark musicbrainz/discogs metadata as wrong — auto-matching has high error rate. Alternative: show "unverified" badge.
- Local file player for mp3/m4a — changes product direction significantly.
- Share track_meta between users — collaborative metadata curation. See https://github.com/radio4000/r4-sync-tests/issues/6
