# PLAN

Possible improvements. Roughly by priority. Verify before implementing.

## Kill `deck-channel-header-shared.js` for decks

`deckTitle(deck, title?)` in `deck.ts` is step 1. The builder (`buildDeckChannelHeaderState`) is now partially redundant. Dismantle it piece by piece:

- title: done -- `deckTitle` handles it. Builder's title fallback (line 90) is dead logic for deck callers.
- `autoUri` in `player.svelte` re-derives `viewLabel || @slug` -- same as `deckTitle(deck)`. Replace.
- tags: builder extracts hashtags from `playlist_title`. Reuse existing mention/hashtag parsing helpers instead.
- slug + slugHref: builder maps slug to href via `toHref`. Move to deck derivation or inline.
- listening who/whom: builder resolves broadcast slugs to hrefs. Move to deck derivation or inline.
- once deck callers don't use the builder, `deck-channel-header-shared.js` shrinks to helpers only (`extractPlaylistHashtags`, `buildTagHref`, `getListeningWhomSlug`) for the channel page.
- channel page (`[slug]/+layout.svelte`) still uses the builder -- separate concern, lower priority. Simplify later once deck path is clean.

## Backlog

- Channel identity inconsistent: `playChannel` takes `{id, slug}`, broadcast functions take just `channelId`
- `pause(player)` doesn't set `deck.is_playing = false` — `togglePlayPause(deckId)` does. Stale state when calling `pause()` directly
- `togglePlay(player)` skips deck state updates and error handling — calls `player.play()` raw. Near-duplicate of `togglePlayPause(deckId)`. Drop both `togglePlay` and `pause(player)`, make callers use `togglePlayPause(deckId)`.
- Consolidate page metadata behind `src/lib/components/seo.svelte` — today some routes use raw `<svelte:head>` because `Seo` always appends `| {appName}` and emits OG tags, while many title messages already hardcode `Radio4000` or custom formatting. Refactor `Seo` into the single metadata path for non-debug routes: support plain/full titles, stop baking brand names into i18n title strings, move default title/description in `src/app.html` to config-driven values, and keep route usage consistent.

## One day

- Test RTL support
- `TrackCard` parses `track.description` with LinkEntities on every render. Consider a DB trigger or cache.
- Media Session API — lock screen and notification controls (play/pause/skip/artwork). Needs research: YouTube/SoundCloud iframes set their own `mediaSession`, may conflict. Our next/prev/seek would work (we proxy via iframe APIs), but play/pause and metadata could fight the iframe.
- Duplicate track detection — warn when adding a URL that already exists in the channel. Could also surface in batch-edit (group by URL or `media_id`).
- Musicbrainz/discogs auto-matching has a high error rate. Let users mark metadata as wrong, or show an "unverified" badge.
- `discogs-core.js:6–8` — in-memory fetch cache grows unbounded. 5-min TTL but no eviction. Long sessions accumulate entries. Could move to a db collection.
- Live query accumulation — navigating creates new queries without cleaning up old ones. Unclear if disposed queries are GC'd or leak.
- Play history threshold: a track is recorded the moment it starts playing. Should count only after enough listening: full track if under 2 min, half the duration (max 4 min) otherwise. Open questions: accumulate actual play time vs. furthest position? What about pause/resume? Should skipped tracks get a `skipped` flag or disappear? Currently `capture('player:track_play')` fires in `playTrack()` (api.ts); would move to `player.svelte` using `timeupdate`. Needs `getPlayCountThreshold(durationSec)` helper and a way to pass `reason_start` to the player.
- `seekWhenReady` race in `broadcast.js` — between the final `seekJobSeqByDeck` check and `play(deckId)`, a new job could start. Old job's `play()` still fires.
- `userHasPlayed` not reset between playlists (`player.svelte`) — flag carries over when switching channels, may cause unexpected autoplay.
- Ephemeral broadcast tracks have `slug: null` (`broadcast.js`) — listeners can't look up non-DB tracks without `track_url`.
- `applyBroadcastState` rebuilds `managedIds` inside loop — O(n²) for deck count. Fine now, may matter later.

## Needs research

- Views beyond tracks — Views are currently tracks-centric: `ViewSource` describes track filters (`channels`, `tags`, `search`), `queryView` returns tracks, `processViewTracks` sorts/filters tracks. Explore whether Views could describe channels or mixed results too (e.g. `searchChannelsCombined` already runs parallel to `queryView` on search pages). Questions: would a `ViewResult` with `{tracks, channels}` simplify search pages further, or would it over-abstract a simple parallel call? Would saved views benefit from storing channel results? Is the current split (Views = tracks, channel search = separate) actually the clearest pattern? May conclude the current design is right and the abstraction isn't worth it.

- `fetchQuery` usage review — `queryClient.fetchQuery` appears in component bodies (`followers`, `following`, `related` pages). Review whether these belong in a collection or loader instead.

- atproto scrobbling — on play, write `fm.teal.alpha.feed.play` to the user's PDS via teal.fm's lexicon. Shared listening history across apps. Requires OAuth account linking, opt-in, one `createRecord` per play. Fire-and-forget, no sync. Proves out atproto OAuth plumbing for everything else.

- atproto as backend — sign in with Bluesky, sync channels/tracks. Major architectural shift. See github.com/radio4000/r4atproto
- Shared track_meta — collaborative metadata curation between users. See github.com/radio4000/r4-sync-tests/issues/6
- Hashtag parsing — should `"#one#two"` be one tag or two? Follow Twitter/Bluesky convention. Decide, update LinkEntities test and regexes. Parsing happens in Postgres, not the app — tests should use the same regexes. Same question applies to `parseQuery` in `views.ts`. Tokenizer splits on whitespace only.
